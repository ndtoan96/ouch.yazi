Make sure you have [ouch](https://github.com/ouch-org/ouch) installed and in your `PATH`.

## Usage

### Preview
For archive preview, add this to your `yazi.toml`:

```toml
[[plugin.prepend_previewers]]
mime = "application/{*zip,tar,bzip2,7z*,rar,xz,zstd,java-archive}"
run  = "ouch"
```

Now go to an archive on Yazi, you should see the archive's content in the preview pane. You can use `J` and `K` to roll up and down the preview.

#### Customization

Previews can be customized by adding extra arguments in the `run` string:

```toml
[plugin]
prepend_previewers = [
	# Change the top-level archive icon
	{ ..., run = "ouch --archive-icon='🗄️ '" },
	# Or remove it by setting it to ''
	{ ..., run = "ouch --archive-icon=''" },

	# Enable file icons
	{ ..., run = "ouch --show-file-icons" },

	# Disable tree view
	{ ..., run = "ouch --list-view" },

	# These can be combined
	{ ..., run = "ouch --archive-icon='🗄️ ' --show-file-icons --list-view" },
]
```

### Compression
For compession, add this to your `keymap.toml`:

```toml
[[mgr.prepend_keymap]]
on = ["C"]
run = "plugin ouch"
desc = "Compress with ouch"
```

The plugin uses `zip` format by default. You can change the format when you name the output file, `ouch` will detect format based on file extension.

And, for example, if you would like to set `7z` as default format, you can use `plugin ouch 7z`.

### Decompression
This plugin does not provide a decompression feature because it already is supported by Yazi.
To decompress with `ouch`, configure the opener in `yazi.toml`.

```toml
[opener]
extract = [
	{ run = 'ouch d -y %*', desc = "Extract here with ouch", for = "windows" },
	{ run = 'ouch d -y "$@"', desc = "Extract here with ouch", for = "unix" },
]
```
